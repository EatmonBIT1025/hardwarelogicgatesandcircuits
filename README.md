A truth table is basically the inputs which are described as truth or false and its purpose details the result of what happens if the inputs are either false or true for every scenario. For a NAND gate if input a is false and input b is false that makes the output true. if input a is false and input b is true that makes the output true. if input a is true and input b is false that makes output true. but if input a and input b are both true that makes the output false.

B. and and nand gates are complete opposites of each other. every inputs combination that makes the output true for and gate creates a false output for nand gate on its truth table. every input combination that makes the output false for and gate make true outputs for nand on its truth table.
